# Mcdonald-s-Market-segmentation-case-study
The purpose of this case study is to offer another illustration of market segmentation analysis using a different empirical data set.
The objective of this case study is to provide an additional example of market segmentation analysis using a different empirical dataset. The dataset was originally collected to compare the effectiveness of various answer formats in survey research on brand image. Detailed information about the data can be found in Dolnicar and Leisch (2012), Dolnicar and Grün (2014), and Grün and Dolnicar (2016). The MSA package includes the relevant sections of the data for this case study.

In this case study, let's assume the role of McDonald's and explore whether distinct consumer segments exist with different perceptions of the McDonald's brand. Identifying systematic variations in brand perceptions among market segments will help us determine which segments to prioritize and what messages to convey to them. We can choose to concentrate on market segments that hold a positive perception and reinforce their favorable view. Alternatively, we may opt to focus on a market segment that currently perceives McDonald's negatively. In this scenario, our aim would be to comprehend the primary drivers of this negative perception and make necessary modifications.
